# Contributing to ansible-openshell

## Running Tests Locally

This repository uses `uv` for reproducible environment management with a pinned lockfile (`uv.lock`). All unit tests are deterministic and require no API keys or live credentials.

### Quick test run:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Syncing dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -v
```

### Running sanity tests:
Ansible sanity tests require the repository to be within an `ansible_collections/aknochow/openshell` directory hierarchy:
```bash
uv run ansible-test sanity --local --python 3.13 -v
```

## Pip wheels

The git root stays a normal collection (`galaxy.yml` + `plugins/`) so
`ansible-test` and `ansible-galaxy collection build` keep working. `pip install`
maps that layout into `site-packages/ansible_collections/aknochow/openshell/`.
The PyPI name is `aknochow-openshell` (not `ansible-openshell` — Ansible trademark).
`ansible_collections/` and `aknochow/` are PEP 420 namespaces: wheels must not
ship `__init__.py` there, or a second collection installed in the same venv
clobbers the first.

`galaxy.yml` `version:` and `[project].version` must stay identical.

Build a wheel (does not upload to PyPI):

```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

Smoke two collections in one clean venv (no `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH`). From
the ansible-ai-dev checkout:

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/coll-wheels && source /tmp/coll-wheels/bin/activate
pip install ./ansible-claude ./ansible-openshell
ansible-doc aknochow.claude.message
ansible-doc aknochow.openshell.sandbox
ansible-galaxy collection list
```

From this repo alone: `pip install .`

Do not upload to PyPI unless a release explicitly says so. Galaxy tarballs
remain the AAP channel (`ansible-galaxy collection build`).
